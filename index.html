                        <p>
                            Our programs serve both traditional first-time students 
                            as well as professionals currently working in the field. 
                            The curriculum is flexible enough to meet the needs of 
                            students who wish to transfer to a baccalaureate 
                            institution and students preparing for immediate 
                            entry into the workplace.

                        <p>
                            Computer Science courses at NCC not only prepare students to 
                            transfer into a baccalaureate institution.  They also serve 
                            those students who wish to enter the workforce directly. 
                            All our courses expose students to the course's underlying CS 
                            theory as well as teach students how to implement those 
                            theories.  The result is students who are prepared for 
                            whatever they choose to do next.
